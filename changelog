## v1.0.2

### Fixed

- Fixed a problem that prevented sending of drive keys

## v1.0.1

### Changed

- The application now automatically checks for the presence of credentials.json upon startup and proceeds if the file is found. Previously, the application would not continue when the file was found.

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue where printing a row containing `$LEFTALIGNED$` text would not obscure the associated tag.

- Corrected an error that caused the key to be displayed in the chat instead of being applied correctly.

- Addressed a formatting issue where the welcome title text would split horizontally on narrow window sizes.

- Fixed a problem that prevented selection after creating a drive, requiring the drive-select menu to be reopened for further actions.
